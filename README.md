# Ruby Magazines Project
This is a simple project that demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts in Ruby. The project consists of three classes, Author, Magazine, and Article, and their respective methods. The classes have various associations and aggregate methods that allow for data retrieval and manipulation.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

bash

Copy code

git clone `git@github.com:ShuaibShaban/ruby-project-phase-3.git`

Open the project directory in a text editor, `Visual Studio Code` .

Open a terminal window in the project directory. shortcut `ctrl + shift + ~`

Install any required gems by running the command:

Copy code
`bundle install`
Run the project by running the command:

Copy code

`ruby articles.rb`

This will run the project's main file, `articles.rb`, and demonstrate the usage of the classes and their methods.

## Usage
To use the project, you can modify the code in the `articles.rb `file to create new instances of the classes and call their respective methods. You can also create new helper methods if needed to aid in data retrieval and manipulation.

The code is commented to explain what each part of the code does, and the various methods of the classes are documented to explain their purpose and usage.
